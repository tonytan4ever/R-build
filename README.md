# R-build

R-build is an [Renv](https://github.com/viking/Renv) plugin
that provides an `Renv install` command to compile and install
different versions of R on UNIX-like systems.

You can also use R-build without Renv in environments where you
need precise control over R version installation.


## Installation

### Installing as an Renv plugin (recommended)

Installing R-build as an Renv plugin will give you access to the
`Renv install` command.

    $ mkdir -p ~/.Renv/plugins
    $ cd ~/.Renv/plugins
    $ git clone git://github.com/tonytan4ever/R-build.git

This will install the latest development version of R-build into
the `~/.Renv/plugins/R-build` directory. From that directory, you
can check out a specific release tag. To update R-build, run `git
pull` to download the latest changes.

### Installing as a standalone program (advanced)

Installing R-build as a standalone program will give you access to
the `R-build` command for precise control over R version
installation. If you have Renv installed, you will also be able to
use the `Renv install` command.

    $ git clone git://github.com/tonytan4ever/R-build.git
    $ cd R-build
    $ ./install.sh

This will install R-build into `/usr/local`. If you do not have
write permission to `/usr/local`, you will need to run `sudo
./install.sh` instead. You can install to a different prefix by
setting the `PREFIX` environment variable.

To update R-build after it has been installed, run `git pull` in
your cloned copy of the repository, then re-run the install script.

## Usage

### Using `Renv install` with Renv

To install a R version for use with Renv, run `Renv install` with
the exact name of the version you want to install. For example,

    $ Renv install 2.15.2

installs R version 2.15.2 to `~/.Renv/versions/2.15.2`. Provide an
additional argument to install to a directory with a name that differs
from the version number. For example,

    $ Renv install 2.15.2 my-proj

installs R version 2.15.2 to `~/.Renv/versions/my-proj`.

To see a list of all available R versions, run `Renv install`
without any arguments. You may also tab-complete available R
versions if your Renv installation is properly configured.

### Using `R-build` standalone

If you have installed R-build as a standalone program, you can use
the `R-build` command to compile and install R versions into
specific locations.

Run the `R-build` command with the exact name of the version you
want to install and the full path where you want to install it. For
example,

    $ R-build 2.15.2 ~/local/R-2.15.2

To see a list of all available R versions, run `R-build
--definitions`.

Pass the `-v` or `--verbose` flag to `R-build` as the first
argument to see what's happening under the hood.

### Custom definitions

Both `Renv install` and `R-build` accept a path to a custom
definition file in place of a version name. Custom definitions let you
develop and install versions of R that are not yet supported by
R-build.

See the [R-build built-in
definitions](https://github.com/viking/R-build/tree/master/share/R-build)
as a starting point for custom definition files.

### Special environment variables

You can set certain environment variables to control the build
process.

* `TMPDIR` sets the location where R-build stores temporary files.
* `R_BUILD_BUILD_PATH` sets the location in which sources are
  downloaded and built. By default, this is a subdirectory of
  `TMPDIR`.
* `CC` sets the path to the C compiler.
* `CONFIGURE_OPTS` lets you pass additional options to `./configure`.
* `MAKE_OPTS` (or `MAKEOPTS`) lets you pass additional options to
  `make`.

### Keeping the build directory after installation

Both `R-build` and `Renv install` accept the `-k` or `--keep`
flag, which tells R-build to keep the downloaded source after
installation. This can be useful if you need to use `gdb` and
`memprof` with R.

Source code will be kept in a parallel directory tree
`~/.Renv/sources` when using `--keep` with the `Renv install`
command. You should specify the location of the source code with the
`R_BUILD_BUILD_PATH` environment variable when using `--keep` with
`R-build`.
